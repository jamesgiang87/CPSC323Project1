??? QUESTIONS ???
???Does the output of the token need to be as user entered? If they entered identifier: Int1
	would our token output say INT1 or Int1?

??? Is the " a separator or symbol?

??? How should we handle encounters with ! comments or "string literals? Should we
    identify the token ! and " but ignore its contents or label contents as identifier tokens?

// !!! NOTES !!!
// !!! CIN AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTS ALL CHARACTERS EXCLUDING WHITESPACE BUT IVE BEEN MANAGING THIS PROBLEM BY 
// !!!  EXTRACTING ONE CHARACTER AT A TIME SO IM NOT SURE MY ALGORITHM/MACHINE WOULD WORK
// 
// **** NEED TO DO ****
// *** ADD FUNCTIONALITY TO MOVE FILE POINTER BACKWARDS BEFORE ADDING CHARACTER TO TOKEN (can only happen
//	with whitespace, operators and separators)
// *** ADD LINE NUMBER AND COLUMN NUMBER VARIABLES TO KEEP TRACK IN LEXER()
// *** CAPATALIZE ALL CHARACTERS IN FILE EXCEPT COMMENTS OR ""
// *** PLEASE CHECK FSM LOGIC!!!
