??? QUESTIONS ???
???Does the output of the token need to be as user entered? If they entered identifier: Int1
	would our token output say INT1 or Int1?
	- Pick either one
??? Is the " a separator or symbol? LINE 473 in RAT18S_Compiler.cpp
	- " is not supported in RAT18S
??? How should we handle encounters with ! comments or "string literals? Should we
    identify the token ! and " but ignore its contents or label contents as identifier tokens?
	- YES THAT IS HOW WE ARE DOING IT
??? Should operators like =+ be an error or counted as = +?
	- COUNT THEM AS SEPERATE OPERATORS
??? Is , and : a separator
	- THEY ARE SEPARATORS
??? We have to check for matching ! comments right because if there isnt a matching ! then 
    we will skip the whole file
