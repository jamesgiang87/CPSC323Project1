??? QUESTIONS ???
???Does the output of the token need to be as user entered? If they entered identifier: Int1
	would our token output say INT1 or Int1?
	- WELL I AM MAKING EVERYTHING CAPITALIZED NOT SURE IF IT SHOULD BE THIS WAY
??? Is the " a separator or symbol? LINE 473 in RAT18S_Compiler.cpp
	- I PUT IT AS AN ERROR UNKNOWN
??? How should we handle encounters with ! comments or "string literals? Should we
    identify the token ! and " but ignore its contents or label contents as identifier tokens?
	- YES THAT IS HOW WE ARE DOING IT
